# BadUSB Script for macOS

This script demonstrates how a BadUSB device can autonomously initiate a terminal session on a macOS system and execute a command without user interaction. Below is a concise overview of the script's functionality, broken down into three main steps.

## Steps

1. **Open Terminal**: The script initiates the Terminal application, which is used for command-line operations on macOS.

2. **Establish a Reverse Shell**: It then executes a command that creates a hidden connection to a remote server, enabling unauthorized access to the macOS system without user awareness.

3. **Terminate the Terminal Session**: Finally, the script closes the Terminal window, ensuring that the user is unaware of any executed commands.
